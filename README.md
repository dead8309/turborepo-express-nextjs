# Turborepo Docker starter

Testing turborepo Deployment on [render](render.com). Will be using this repo for future references to deploy turborepo apps on render.

## Basic Idea

Express App should be deployed to render and frontend apps on vercel or other platforms.
But this example deploys both of them to render as two web services

> [!NOTE]
> There are some problem in running the next app in docker which can be solved by specifying the port from env
